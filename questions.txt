1.  Getrusage returns the measures of resources of the current process and future processes.  This is the program that will tell us how fast our program is 
    running. 
2.  16
3.  You want to find out how many resources are being used before the dictionary is loaded and then after the dictionary is loaded.  The pointer
    variables before and after are used for simplicity sake, so you don't have to write out the entire struct.   
4.  The fgetc function is essentially a getchar function for files.  This function is getting each letter from the file until the endof 
    file has been hit and putting each letter into the array [word].  The function consists of 3 branches. 
     1.  For words greater than 45 characters. The function consumes the rest of the word overwriting each letter in array [0]. 
     2.  Structurally similar to 1. but for numbers.  
     3.  When end of word (/o) has been reached for non long, non number words. It than spell checks the word.  
5.    I think that fscanf you run into the same overflow problems that plague scanf.  The fgetc function allows you to deal with this eventuallity.   
6.   The difference between char* and const char* is a const char * you can't dereference/change/edit the word.  You  can still change what 
     the const char* points to.  The spell checker shouldn't modify the document it is trying to correct.  At least not in this version!.
